## Hey, I'm Kashish

I'm a software engineer who mostly builds web frontends but tends to get distracted by other interesting things — home automation, microcontrollers, and random hardware projects.

- Writing code that's simple and gets the job done
- These days messing around with Raspberry Pi, Home Assistant, and microcontrollers
- Mostly in JavaScript/TypeScript, but honestly whatever works
- Into cooking — I find it oddly similar to debugging, just tastier
- Still pick up the camera and drumsticks when the mood strikes
- My cats supervise most of my projects
- Always learning by building. Prefer working on things I'd actually use
